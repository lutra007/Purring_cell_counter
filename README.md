# Purring_cell_counter
**Purring cell counter**

This simple Python program helps to count cells (or anything) under the microscope.
Run it in Terminal:
1) Enter any symbols you will use to count different types of cell (i.e., 1 - living, 2 - dead);
2) Input the total number of cells you plan to count;
3) Then go to the microscope and just press 1, 1, 2, 2, 1... When you reach the total number of cells for this measurement, the program will alarm you with purring! 
4) In the report, you will see counts for each symbol you used and its fraction from the total.


**Requirements**
